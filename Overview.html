							<p>To learn and explore the life of humans before us, cultural heritage
								(CH) sites must be preserved. A popular preservation tactic uses
								digital technologies such as terrestrial laser scanners to scan the CH
								site and construct applicable 3D models. These models allow preservationists to determine where the site is spoilt for the development
								of appropriate conservation strategies. The recordings of the scans
								are stored as point clouds. Point clouds consist of points defined
								by spatial coordinates (X,Y,Z). However, the point clouds often contain noise
								and unwanted points from the structure, such as scaffolding, people, animals and vegetation, making an accurate 3D model difficult to
								obtain. Point cloud cleaning has been explored to discard these unwanted points, but this process is manual, labour-intensive and
								time-consuming even for a highly skilled individual. Additionally,
								the structures of CH sites vary, making it tough to formulate a general cleaning model. Therefore, finding an accurate and automatic
								solution presents a unique challenge.</p>
							<p> We propose a framework that tries to simplify and accelerate the point cloud cleaning task by investigating the decomposition of point clouds
								into semantically meaningful clusters of 3D points through point
								feature clustering. This materialises though three sub-projects in which partitional, density-based and Hierarchical algorithms are implemented. <p>
							</p> Additionally, we explore whether or not clustering can augment
								the classification process to form groupings that can be classified using binary classification labels of
								’keep’ and ’discard’. </p>
